One thing i have always been passionate about in my life is food! Food has never let me down no matter what. Anytime I am feeling down i know food will be there to pick me right back up. Anytime i feel stressed i know food has got my back. When i'm not busy with work or school i'm probably eating food. I just love food so, much that it's practically all i even think about or dream about. Bottom line is i love food so i wanted to make an app that has to do with food! What better thing to make an app over? Well i had my subject and now i had to create an idea of how to work my food into my app. At first i thought of doing a restaraunt rater like a yelp kind of app but then i didn't know how i would meet all the requirements, but then i thought about a recipe book type project! I'm constantly cooking so what better place to save my recipes and share them with the world than an app!
Where i started, i started my app by creating an idea of what i wanted, but that kept changing as i was coding and was trying to fit the project requirements into my project. it progressively increased in difficulty at an alarming rate but i was able to pull it off. I would have 4 different tables, users, recipes, comments, and ingredients.
I started with what tables i wanted then i created models for all the tables, as i started with my MVC structure. Then i moved on to the controllers which i made through generators. Finally i made the views.
The most challenging part of the project was getting the many to many function working as it was what took me the longest to research how to work it into my specific app.
Creating the users and such were the easy part as i had spent a lot of time struggling with that in sinatra and rails is very similar in structure.
In the end i got my code working and was happy with all the hardwork i had put into my app!
