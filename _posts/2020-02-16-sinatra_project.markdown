The Sinatra project was very challenging. Building out the views was fairly simple, it was keeping track of what did what in your code and figuring out how to save posts that you could later come back to and then editing them or deleting them if need be. I built out an application that can be used for keeping track of pet inventory in an animal shelter. Shelter owners can create an account and see the inventory of other shelters or they can make their own inventory post, as well as delete or edit their own. A shelter owner can own many shelters but a shelter can only belong to one owner. The only thing you need to sign up is an email and a password. The process started off very simply by creating an idea of what i wanted to build but very quickly became more complex as actually putting it into action was often harder than it seemed.
