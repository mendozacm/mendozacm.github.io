My CLI project is a very simple project it has 2 layers, the first being one that shows you todays 20 trending movies. The second layer allows you to interact with it and you get to choose which movie you would like more information about. It uses an API to get the data on the movies. The API I used was the themoviedb.org, it was free but it required an authorization key that reuired you to make an account to access it. This was my first time writing code like this and it was definitely a challenge, I was constantly having to debug why things weren't working as intended and how to make it better. The biggest challenge I faced was getting the API to work but after hours of trying to find the problem in my code it had turned out I had added an extra letter in the name of the website. Overall this project was really helpful in helping me learn and apply what we have learned so far, i've probably learned more during this project than i did through the modules.
